# python-tarot

This is slight modification of Jeremy Tarling's simple python-tarot application.  I modified to do 5 and 7 card draws -- taught myself to learn how to do that based on Jeremy's awesome work.  I hope to further update it with other modifications unique to a more Soul Envoy/Ambassador usage.

It is a simple web application written in Python to draw one or more randomly selected cards from a dictionary of 72 Tarot card description and image references.

The card images used are Arthur Waite's deck, by artist Pamela Colman Smith. According to Wikipedia they are out of copyright in the US now and will be in the UK in 2022.
